## Tech_challenge : CARTO PNEU

### Observation : The heavier a harvester is, the more its tires sag.

Form that simple observation, we would like to know if it is possible to create programs that geo-reference sagging intensity of field harvesters. 
Then the ultimate goal is to correlate these sagging intensity with the harvester's filling thus to the yield.
