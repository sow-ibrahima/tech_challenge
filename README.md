### Observation : The heavier a harvester is, the more its tires sag

Form that simple observation, we would like to know if it is possible to create programms that georeference sagging intensity of field harvesters. 
Then the ultimate goal is to correlate these sagging intensity with the harvester's filling thus to the yield.
